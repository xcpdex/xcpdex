<p>We at XCPDEX.com know that you care how your information is used, and we appreciate your trust. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting us, you are accepting the privacy policy described below.</p>

<h3>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h3>
<p><strong>Information You Provide.</strong> We receive and store information you enter. For example, when you search for something, or leave a comment, or when you supply information such as your address, phone number or e-mail address. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of some of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing your experience, improving our Web site, and communicating with you.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies.</strong> Like many web sites, we use "cookies". Cookies are small programs that we transfer to your hard drive that allow us to recognize you and to provide you with a customized experience. If you do not want us to use cookies, you can easily disable them by going to the toolbar of your web browser, and clicking on the "help" button. Follow the instructions that will prevent the browser from accepting cookies, or set the browser to inform you when you receive a new cookie. In addition, you may visit this and other websites anonymously through the use of utilities provided by other private companies.</p>
<p>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our website. Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our sites and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting the ads preference manager. (Alternatively, they can opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for interest based advertising by visiting aboutads.info.)</p>

In addition, we automatically collect other information such as email addresses, browser types, operating systems, and the URL addresses of sites clicked to and from this site.</p>

<h3>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h3>
<p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</p>
<p>No system can guarantee absolute security, just as the finest lock can not guarantee physical security. However, we take every reasonable precaution to assure that your data is secure. We limit access to your information on a "need to know" basis.</p>

<h3>Other Websites</h3>
<p>Various Web sites may be linked to from this site. If we link to another site, your privacy depends on the policy of that site. We strongly urge you to check their privacy policy. Not all sites guarantee that they will not share your personally identifiable information with others.</p>
